# Mental Health in Social Media - Sentiment Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze social media content to gain insights into public mental health trends. By employing machine learning and NLP techniques, we explore how social media narratives relate to mental health.

## Data Source
The data consists of anonymized posts from platforms like Twitter and Reddit, focusing on mental health topics. Rigorous data preprocessing ensures relevance and quality.

## Techniques Used
### Preprocessing
- **Text Normalization**: Ensuring uniformity in the data.
- **Data Integration**: Combining datasets for a holistic view.
- **Null Value Treatment**: Cleaning up data for analysis.

### Machine Learning Models
- **Baseline Models**: Testing with SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, and TinyBERT.
- **Advanced Model**: Developing a custom model with enhanced NLP capabilities.

## Key Findings
- The effectiveness of different models in identifying mental health-related content varies, with the custom model showing significant promise.
- In-depth analysis results are available in the 'Analysis' folder.

## Challenges
- Complexities in data handling and model tuning.
- Resource constraints impacting computational processes.
- Detailed discussion in the 'Issues' document.

## Future Scope
Discuss potential enhancements and future research directions:
-Applying the model to diverse datasets.
-Enhancing model accuracy through advanced techniques.
-Scaling up the project to include more extensive data sources.
